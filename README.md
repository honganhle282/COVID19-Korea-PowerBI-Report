# COVID-19 Data Analysis in South Korea

This repository contains a Power BI report that analyzes COVID-19 data in South Korea. The report leverages DAX functions for in-depth calculations and visualizations to uncover trends in COVID-19 cases, fatalities, and vaccinations.
This repository is an analysis and visualization of COVID-19 Pandemic spread in South Korea from 01/20/2020 to 06/30/2020 by DS4C.

## Dataset
- Case.csv (Data of COVID-19 infection cases)
- PatientInfo.csv (Epidemiological data of COVID-19 patients)
- PatientRoute.csv (Route data of COVID-19 patients)
- Region.csv (Location and statistical data of the regions)
- SearchTrend.csv (Trend data of the keywords searched in NAVER which is one of the largest portals)
- SeoulFloating.csv (Data of floating population in Seoul, South Korea (from SK Telecom Big Data Hub))
- Time.csv (Time series data of COVID-19 status)
- TimeAge.csv (Time series data of COVID-19 status in terms of the age)
- TimeGender.csv (Time series data of COVID-19 status in terms of gender)
- TimeProvince.csv (Time series data of COVID-19 status in terms of the Province)
- Weather.csv (Data of the weather in the regions)

## Tools and Techniques Used

- **Power BI**: Used for data visualization and reporting.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Implemented for custom calculations, such as cumulative case counts, moving averages, and conditional measures for deeper insights.
## üìä DAX Formulas Used

This project utilizes several DAX formulas to perform calculations and derive insights. Here are some key formulas implemented in the Power BI report:

### 1. PATIENT PER INFECTION CASE
```dax
PATIENT PER INFECTION CASE = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(PatientInfo),ALL(PatientInfo))
```
### 2. % RELEASE GROWTH
```dax
% RELEASE GROWTH = (MAX('Time'[released]) - (CALCULATE(MAX('Time'[released]),DATEADD('Time'[date],-1,DAY))))/(CALCULATE(MAX('Time'[released]),DATEADD('Time'[date],-1,DAY)))
```
### 3. % CONFIRMED GROWTH
```dax
% CONFIRMED GROWTH = (MAX('Time'[confirmed])-[CONFIRMED PREVIOUS DAY])/[CONFIRMED PREVIOUS DAY]
```
### 4. % DEAD GROWTH
```dax
DEAD PREVIOUS DAY = CALCULATE(MAX('Time'[deceased]),DATEADD('Time'[date],-1,DAY))
% DEAD GROWTH = (MAX('Time'[deceased])-[DEAD PREVIOUS DAY])/[DEAD PREVIOUS DAY]
```
### 5. Fatality Ratio
```dax
Fatality Ratio = MAX('Time'[deceased])/MAX('Time'[confirmed])
```
